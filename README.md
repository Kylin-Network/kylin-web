## Project Overview

Kylin Network aims to Build a Cross-chain Platform Empowering the Data Economy on Polkadot. It offers any applications and blockchains (such as parachains and parathreads) instantaneous but reliable and valid on/off-chain market data and social data sources by leveraging the power of [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/)/[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) Framework. 

## The Problems to Address
- In a mature web 3.0 world, the number of data sources will be diverse and many, and will not be limited to price feeds alone Indeed, proper middleware will also have as its focus things such as stock price, twitter feeds, real-time election results. The need for an array of validated data resources has never been higher.
- Due to the previous lack of [off-chain workers (OCW)](https://www.parity.io/substrate-2-0-is-here/), many off-chain data cannot efficiently get connected to the blockchain. [Substrate 2.0 framework](https://www.parity.io/substrate-2-0-is-here/) provides OCWs as a default solution to [integrate real-world data](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/oracle) safely and securely onto the blockchain via oracles without the need to get opt-in by each validator - in other words, it’s a default unlocking of oracle validation across all of substrate.
- There are many weaknesses of Ethereum, especially high transaction cost and low scalability. Thus, implementation based on the cost-effective Polkadot network and its cross-chain interoperability is a better solution for the blockchain ecosystem.
- Kylin Network would also provide the means to integrate into OCW functionalities and (Dapp builders’ capabilities) what would be essentially tantamount to a single, easy-to-use request library. 

## Project Architecture

The architecture of Kylin Network includes below main components:

- **Kylin Data Oracle** is a decentralized oracle network powered by Polkadot offering multiple, real-time data sources. In addition to the complementarity and synergy to off-chain workers (OCW), Kylin seeks to extend the data provisional resources of the Polkadot network across all possible data types/sources including, but not limited to things like social media posts, flight information, exchange rates, weather reporting, etc.
- **Kylin Data Marketplace** is an open platform for the data economy. Dapps built on Polkadot can access this platform to easily and efficiently collect both off-chain and on-chain data only paying a very competitive fee.
- **Kylin Data Analytics** is a combination of analyzing tools designed for data warehouses. It extracts meaningful data findings, patterns, interpretation, and finally implements low-cost commercialization functionalities for the public.
- **Kylin Token $KYL** is the native token of Kylin Network which will play the role of governance and other utilities. $KYL is necessary to secure and power the decentralized oracle network.

## Substrate/Polkadot Integration

Polkadot ecosystem and the newly-updated Substrate 2.0 are essential to what Kylin Network is trying to achieve. Kylin Oracle will be connected to the Polkadot ecosystem acting as a parachain, sharing the Polkadot underlying consensus, and protected by the network performance of Polkadot and Substrate. Polkadot/Kusama is the important foundation, on which Kylin Network and its components are built.

The pallets that come with the Substrate 2.0 upgrade can offer Kylin Network the tools and maps to navigate through our vision, which is to build a decentralized oracle that offers on/off-chain data with built-in interoperability.  Off-chain worker (OCW) is a substrate subsystem which can process off-chain data in an asynchronous way. It is a new feature in Substrate 2.0 that allows to integrate data onto the blockchain.
