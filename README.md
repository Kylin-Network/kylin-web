# Kylin Network README
 
## Project Overview
Kylin Network aims to build a decentralized network empowering the data economy on Polkadot to offer any applications and blockchains (such as parachains and parathreads) instantaneous but reliable and valid on/off-chain data sources by leveraging the power of [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate).

## [The problems Kylin Network to address](https://wiki.kylin.network/about-kylin-network)

1. **The lack of valid external data still hinders the future development.** In a mature web 3.0 world, the number of data sources will be diverse, and will not be limited to price feeds alone.

2. Due to the previous lack of [off-chain workers (OCW)](https://www.parity.io/substrate-2-0-is-here/), many off-chain data cannot efficiently get connected to the blockchain. [Substrate 2.0 framework](https://www.parity.io/substrate-2-0-is-here/) provides OCWs as a default solution to [integrate real-world data](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/oracle) safely and securely onto the blockchain via oracles without the need to get opt-in by each validator - in other words, it’s a **default unlocking of oracle validation** across all of substrate.

3. There are many weaknesses of Ethereum, especially **high transaction cost and low scalability.** Thus, implementation based on the cost-effective Polkadot network and its cross-chain interoperability is a better solution for the blockchain ecosystem.

4. Kylin Network would also provide the means to integrate into OCW functionalities and (Dapp builders’ capabilities) what would be essentially tantamount to a single, easy-to-use request library.
 

## [Project components](https://wiki.kylin.network/page-two)

The architecture of Kylin Network includes below main components:
- **Kylin Data Oracle** is a decentralized oracle network powered by Polkadot offering multiple, real-time data sources. 

- **Kylin Data Marketplace** is an open platform for the data economy. Dapps built on Polkadot can access this platform to easily and efficiently collect both on/off chain data only by paying a very competitive fee.

- **Kylin Data Analytics** is a combination of analyzing tools designed for data warehouses. It extracts meaningful data findings, patterns, interpretation, and finally implements low-cost data commercialization for the public.

- **Kylin Token $KYL** is the native token of Kylin Network which will play the role of governance and other utilities. $KYL is necessary to secure and power the decentralized oracle network.
 

## Substrate/Polkadot Integration

Polkadot ecosystem and the newly-updated Substrate 2.0 are essential to what Kylin Network is trying to achieve. Kylin Oracle will be connected to the Polkadot ecosystem acting as a parachain, sharing the Polkadot underlying consensus, and protected by the network performance of Polkadot and Substrate. Polkadot/Kusama is the important foundation, on which Kylin Network and its components are built.
 

## [Privacy and Security](https://wiki.kylin.network/page-two)
As the cyber security incidents and cryptocurrency hacks are quickly becoming a regular occurrence and exposing confidential business information. The team decides to employ a novel approach to manage user identity in blockchain services.

## [Token Economics](https://wiki.kylin.network/kylin-network-token-economics)  

$KYL is necessary to secure and power the decentralized network. The use-cases and utility of $KYL include: **Stake to be Oracle Node and Arbitrator Node, Intermediary of Exchange and On-chain Governance.**  
The specifically designed governance process allows the token holders to have decision making power in shaping a truly decentralized oracle network.

## [Application Scenarios of Kylin Network](https://wiki.kylin.network/pplication-scenarios-of-kylin-network)

- Decentralized insurance automatic payment
